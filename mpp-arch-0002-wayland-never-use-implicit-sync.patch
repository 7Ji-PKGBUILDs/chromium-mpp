Subject: [PATCH] wayland: never use implicit sync

Current chromium logic is to use it for kernels that "supposedly" supports
implicit sync, that is, any kernel >= 6.0. However, our BSP kernels never
follow the mainline feature set, and implicit sync is yet another
feature they do not support.

Disable it always by making function
ui::WaylandConnection::UseImplicitSyncInterop always return false  so
we touch as few codes as possible, and hopefully clang would inline and
kill the dead codes.
